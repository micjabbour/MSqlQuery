/*!
 * \brief The MSqlQuery class provides means of executing a single SQL statement
 *        synchronously or asynchronously.
 *
 * The class provides a subset of the interface of QSqlQuery, in addition to
 * some asynchronous functions. It can be used to execute any kind of SQL
 * statement on a database and get results synchronously or asynchronously. Most
 * of the functions in the class are just wrappers that call corresponding Qt
 * functions in the "right" thread.
 *
 * The class has a synchronous API, that can be used in the same way QSqlQuery
 * is used. The following snippet shows how to execute an SQL query and retrieve
 * results synchronously using MSqlQuery (similar to the QSqlQuery example):
 *
 *     MSqlQuery query("SELECT country FROM artist");
 *     while (query.next()) {
 *         QString country = query.value(0).toString();
 *         doSomething(country);
 *     }
 *
 * The class also has an asynchronous API, that can be used to execute a query
 * asynchronously. You can call functions that end with `Async()` (e.g.
 * execAsync(), execBatchAsync()). These functions emit a signal resultsReady()
 * when execution is finished. You can connect to this signal, and access the
 * results the same way as when using the synchronous API. Here is the same
 * example above written asynchronously:
 *
 *     //create an MSqlQuery object, and provide some parent to manage its lifetime
 *     MSqlQuery* query = new MSqlQuery(parent);
 *     //connect to resultsReady signal
 *     QObject::connect(&query, &MSqlQuery::resultsReady, [=](bool success){
 *         if(success) {
 *     	    while (query->next()) {
 *             QString country = query->value(0).toString();
 *             doSomething(country);
 *     	} else {
 *     	    //statement failed to execute
 *     		qDebug() << query->lastError().databaseText();
 *     	}
 *     });
 *     //make sure to keep the lifetime of the MSqlQuery object as long as you
 *     //don't want to cancel the ongoing operation
 *
 * The class also supports using QSqlQuery's batch execution mode. This can be
 * done using the functions execBatch() (for synchronous execution) and
 * execBatchAsync() (for asynchronous execution)
 * 
 * \note There is no concept of an "active" query in MSqlQuery. All exec
 * functions in the class (whether they are synchronous or asynchronous)
 * retrieve all results of a query and caches them to avoid blocking while
 * trying to retrieve them later. This can be less efficient in cases where the
 * query returns a large amount of data, but should be okay when you are not
 * blocking the GUI thread.

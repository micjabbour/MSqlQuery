/*!
 * \brief The MSqlQueryModel class provides a read-only data model for accessing
 *        SQL result sets synchronously or asynchronously.
 * 
 * The class provides a subset of the interface of QSqlQueryModel, in addition 
 * to some asynchronous functions. It can be used to provide data to Qt
 * view classes (such as `QTableView`) synchronously (block the GUI thread until
 * results are ready) or asynchronously (update the view when results get
 * ready). It can be used in the same way `QSqlQueryModel` is usually used, for
 * example:
 * 
 *     MSqlQueryModel *model = new MSqlQueryModel;
 *     model->setQuery("SELECT name, salary FROM employee");
 *     
 *     QTableView *view = new QTableView;
 *     view->setModel(model);
 *     view->show();
 * 
 * The above example will block the executing thread until the query returns (
 * the same way `QSqlQueryModel` behaves). MSqlQueryModel can be used to update
 * data asynchronously. You can call functions that end with `Async()` (e.g. 
 * setQueryAsync()) to do this. Here is the same example above written
 * asynchronously:
 * 
 *     MSqlQueryModel *model = new MSqlQueryModel;
 *     model->setQueryAsync("SELECT name, salary FROM employee");
 *     
 *     QTableView *view = new QTableView;
 *     view->setModel(model);
 *     view->show();
 * 
 * The above example works by running the query asynchronously, and resetting 
 * the model when the query is done. It does not block the GUI thread. The View
 * continues to display old data until the query is finished.
 * 
 * The model can also be subclassed (the same way `QSqlQueryModel` can) to
 * customize the contents of the data before showing it to the user.
